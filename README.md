# Welcome
* You are interested in Insights Hub?
* You want to know, what you can do with it?
* You've heard about Visual Flow Creator and want to try it out?
* You know already Visual Flow Creator but search for examples?
* You want to get inspired by other flows from the community?

This repository provides example flows to be used in Visual Flow Creator (VFC). You can use them and try it out to get an impression what is possible. Additionally you can customize them to your use cases. And of course you can contribute to this repository and share your knowledge to others.

If you do not have already purchased the app, you can get it in the [Store](https://www.dex.siemens.com/mindsphere/applications/Visual-Flow-Creator). Or if you do not already have an account to Insights Hub, get one at [Start](https://www.mindsphere.io/start).

## How does this work

In the next chapter you will find example flows. There is always a readme with a short description, what this flow does.
There is an image showing the flow to get an impression of the complexity.

And there is the most important thing - the json file, which you can import as a new flow into your Visual Flow Creator.

Please note, that the json-files are exported from another tenant. So their might be fields which you have to adapt, that the flow is able to run in your tenant.

### Example template
You want to create your own example? Just copy the [template flow-directory](./x_templateFlow/), adapt it and send us your pull request.
## Remarks
Please note that the screenshots show just the current state, when these examples have been created. They might differ to the latest software release.

Each flow has to be adapted to your tenant. Ensure, that e.g. fixed tenant names or asset ids are adapted before/after you import the flow.

## Prerequisites
All application examples shown in this repository require the application *Visual Flow Creator (VFC)*. 

To use them, ensure that
- VFC is available in your tenant ([VFC in Store](https://www.dex.siemens.com/mindsphere/applications/visual-flow-creator))
![image](./Launchpad_VFC.png)
- you have *admin* or *user* access to VFC ([VFC user role settings](https://documentation.mindsphere.io/MindSphere/apps/Visual-Flow-Creator/user-rights.html))
![image](./VFC_roles.png)

If you can see Visual Flow Creator on your Launchpad, you're ready to start developments.
